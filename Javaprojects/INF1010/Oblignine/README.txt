Time complexity o(n)
names .txt  file takes an average og 15 milleseconds to sort and merge
snowpods.txt takes an average og 150 milleseconds to sort and merge
There some method that have many iteration (for loops) 
which affect the compecity of our program. Loops have o(n) and 
The insertion sort we used has a complexity of on average o(n^2)and merge sort 
we used on fletting was not exact merge sort. it was more linear and 
it complexity  is o(n)
