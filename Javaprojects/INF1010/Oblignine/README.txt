Oblig   nine inf1010

1. This oblig was quite  relevant to what learnt in the past leactures.It
   was a good training for implementing threads .
2.  We used rougly many  hrs(some days).
3.  I worked  with my groupemate yoseph Gebrehiwet.
4 . We have done the  all questions as per the assignment requirement.
and We have made the programme to be more robust by catching error and exception.
We have also implemented som helping method like 
1.)isSorted- which if it return true data is written output
2.) ingen_null_Index-That checks no index in the array contain nothing


Time complexity o(n)
names .txt  file takes an average og 15 milleseconds to sort and merge
snowpods.txt takes an average og 150 milleseconds to sort and merge
There some method that have many iteration (for loops) 
which affect the compecity of our program. Loops have o(n) and 
The insertion sort we used has a complexity of on average o(n^2)and merge sort 
we used on fletting was not exact merge sort. it was more linear and 
it complexity  is o(n)
