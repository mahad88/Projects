	My program has four classes
	obligone.java which has the main method
	readFile.java
	BinaryTree.java
	spell_check java

	Two files
	dictionary.txt->which i read 
	utskrift.txt    -> i have copied from the terminal after terminal

How to compile
	javac *.javac
	java obligone
any assumption
        i have assumed that the how i calculate the number of lookups is right
        i could not verify like the way did with the other implimentations
Any perculiarities
	Because i am adding the similar word i find to linked list, it add duplicates
        for example achievee get achieve twice. i thought if remove the duplicates it will
        affect the efficiency. 
program status 
        i have implemented all the assignment to my understand and did confirmation from the group
        teacher assitant.i have tested all the method if with a small file to see all the metho are ok

source 
	my major source has been the syllabus book 
        from page  112-123
        also the first two lecture notes.
