READING THE FILE()
This method has several loop which will affect
the efficiency. because each complexity is loop is O(N).
Since we go to every vertices and edges once.

 HASCYCLIC()
 This method has a complexity is O(|V| + |E|)=O(n)since we
iterate through each node and edges (standard dfs complexity).

For both createEvent(), earlyStart(),LatestStart() complexitity is 
O(|V| + |E|) because all node and edges are gone through for any
operarion.
The startTraversion(),PrintTasks() Have also O(|V| + |E|).
We go through each task.
Since most of the method have O(|V| + |E|) , the program complexity
is O(N).
