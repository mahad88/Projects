My program works as it should. I have sent two test files that show the output of my program
and two log files.

The program consists of 
1. Decoder
2. Counter
3. Main

	1.Decoder
The decoder I have built take 4-bit input and activates one of the instructions.
The instruction that's activated are 1000(LSB),1001(MSB),1010(Load) and 1011(WE). 
The decoder will be used in the main (I will explain in the main part).

	2.Counter.
The counter is built from 4 half adder that i made myself and a register. The counter 
start from 0000 to 1111. It takes two input a constant and the value it gets from the
register. The counter will be connected to program memory in the main part of my program

	3.Main
Since i have implemented my program with Harvard architecture i have separate program 
memory and Data memory. It also has several other components.

1. Program memory -it takes input from the counter i made (at A) and its output are sent
 (at D) Data memory and the decoder. The first 4 bit (MBS)are sent the decoder and the 
last 4 bit (LSB) are sent to the Data memory.

2. Decoder-it take 4-bit input from the program memory and send 4 output-LSB, MSB, Load 
to Data memory and WE to Data memory also. The LSB and MSB are combined in a splitter 
and will be the input for Register and Data memory (at D).

3. Register- Its labeled as  "R" .It takes input instruction bus at D  and send output 
to itself with the help of two set of 4 bit tri sate buffers.

4.Data memory- Take inputs  1010 (at ld) , 1011 (at sel) , program data from D  to  
A in data memory and  from the instruction bus to its D . it also a clock and a reseter 
. to clear to reset.
